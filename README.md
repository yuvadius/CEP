# CEP
A generic CEP library in python.

As Wikipedia states, Complex event processing, or CEP, is event processing that combines data from multiple sources to infer events or patterns that suggest more complicated circumstances.

CEP executes a set of algorithms which, as said, can infer events, patterns and sequences. The input of these algorithms are events and queries, and the result of these calculations are patterns.

The algorithms are exposed with an API, so you can add or remove algorithms freely.
